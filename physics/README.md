# Wave Dispersion Simulation
The brief code snippet in this Jupyter Notebook simulates wave packet propagation and dispersion given the [dispersion relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_relation) and animates or visualizes the output.  See `waveDispersion.ipynb` for the code, examples, and more information.
